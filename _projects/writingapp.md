Building a Progressive Web App with TypeScript without a Framework.

My wife likes to write, but hasn't been satisfied with any writing software.
I have been looking for another project to learn Web technologies.


## Objectives

Minimal and Streamlined UI for writing a novel.

- Progressive Web App for offline access
- Use TypeScript to generate JS
- NodeJS for dependency management
- Portable Dev environment in Docker Container
