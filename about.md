### Implementing DevOps best practices 
Working on a small team with a big job, migrating the products of cowboy coders and snowflake servers to a reliable, repeatable, and testable infrastructure and codebase.

### Expanding my skills

I'm usually working on some project to learn something new. Server Administration, Web Development, DevOps (Ansible, Docker, Jenkins, Gitlab...), Excel Macros, anything to improve my skillset and tool belt.:wq
